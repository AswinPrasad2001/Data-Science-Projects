Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
The goal is to help travelers, airlines, and aggregators estimate airfare prices more accurately based on multiple influencing factors like airline, source city, destination, travel duration, class, and days left for departure.

Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing — Removed null values, handled outliers, and standardized formats.
Feature Engineering — Encoded categorical variables (airline, source, class) and scaled numerical features for better model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Identified relationships between variables and price using visualizations.
Model Training & Evaluation — Implemented and compared Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
High Accuracy — Achieved an R² Score of 0.98 and RMSE of ~2735, with Random Forest performing the best.
Feature Importance Analysis — Identified top factors influencing flight prices.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Tools: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Algorithms Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor
